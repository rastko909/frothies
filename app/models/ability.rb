    # Define abilities for the passed in user here. For example:
    #
      user ||= User.new # guest user (not logged in)

    # NOTE: best practice according to cancancommunity, try to implement next week

    # return unless user.present?
    # can :manage, Product, user_id #shit user can manage when logged in
    # return unless user.is_vendor? #shit vendors can manage
    # can :manage, xxx
    #

    # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
    # permission to do.
    # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
    # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
    #
    # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
    # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
    # class of the resource.
    #
    # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
    # objects.
    # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
    #
    #   can :update, Article, :published => true
